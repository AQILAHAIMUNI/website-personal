    <center><p style="font-size: 25"> Now let me story about how ODL make me so stress and I'm almost quit. First is my internet connection is very slow ebven I use a wife. Maybe my house is not in their covarage that why my internet is very slow. But there no option because lot of wifi is not cover my area. That make so stress. Second is stress. Actually ODL make me very very stress. I need to cook for my sibling, make a housework and at the same time I need to join the class doing my assignment. It's very tired. Maybe for the boys didnt feel it because they only know to eat and sleep like my brother. Third is surrounding. Even my is terrace housing area but there no common sense from my neighborhood. They always modified their motocycle and it very noise until that sound was heard in my video presentation. This want make so mad. I almost want scolding them harshly. Too close u know.  </p></center>
